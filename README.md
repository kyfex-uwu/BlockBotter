# BlockBotter

BlockBotter is a fast and intuitive way for *anyone* to create a Discord Bot! Powered by [discordjs](discord.js.org) and Google's [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly), BlockBotter is a NodeJS application that lets you control/code your Discord bot in real time, using block-based coding.

# Features
 - Block based, event driven coding
 - Code that updates instantly
 - A built-in client that can show your bot working in real time (as long as your bot has the right permissions)

# Getting started

### Requirements
 - NodeJS and npm
 - and that's it!

### To use
To set up, download the [latest source code](https://github.com/kyfex-uwu/DiscordBotInterfaceJS/releases/latest) and extract it. Then, to run the app, there are 2 options:
 - Execute `start.bat`
 - Run the command `npm install` inside that folder to install the dependencies. Then, running `node app.js` will start the app any subsequent times.
